After quite some time of procrastination, I told my husband yesterday that I wasn’t quite sure if writing a blog is for me.  I told him I didn’t know what to write about, I didn’t know what topics would be interesting and if I would have enough knowledge to share…

He then asked me: “Would you write if there is no one who read your blog?”, to which the immediate response that came to my mind was “Of course, that would make things easier”. Suddenly, I realised how my fear of others’ reaction had pulled me back from embarking on an activity that excited me.

There is also another heavy reason which is a lingering question in my head: "What if I fail and realise that I’m so bad at blogging?" My self-esteem will be hurt and broken!



As I revealed my worries and fears to my husband, I realised how stupid I was, worrying about many things that even not happen yet. 

Yes, I may write something very boring, other people may laugh at me when they read these craps, but there are at least 2 things I will gain from it:


- Best, I will learn to live with others’ judgement and not be affected by negative ones. Worst, actually people wouldn’t care less to give a judgement to my blog. Another interesting insight about this judgement thing is, I think I will likely be the one who judge and stop my work even before publishing it. If this is the case, I want to see how “generous” and “loving” I could be to accept where I’m at.

- One thing for sure, I will learn a lot from those craps that I write. It’ll be a process of learning and improving. I imagine how cool it would be, a few years from now, to read back what I wrote and see how far I have gone.

Yes, I may fail at this project, I may realise that writing is not for me, blogging is not for me. So what? At least I’ll learn that from giving it a try and not by speculating in my head how good or how bad I could be. Failing in reality is still better than winning in the imagination.

Sometimes we keep procrastinating to start an exciting project because we’re so afraid of failing. Today I see how it rings true to me. If so, I will do it, to explore if I would actually fail at it. 

As the title of this site suggests, I want to write anything that I experience about choosing a happy life. 

For a start, as a process of experimenting if blogging is for me, I will not stop until I reach 30 entries in this site. 

The timing is never right - I read this sentence in “The 4-hour work week” yesterday. Here it goes:

“For all of the most important things, the timing always sucks… Conditions are never perfect. “Someday” is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it’s important to you and you want to do it “eventually,” just do it and correct course along the way”.

I look forwards to many corrections and improvements that I’ll make a long the way :)
