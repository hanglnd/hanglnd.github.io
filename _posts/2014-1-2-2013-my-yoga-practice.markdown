I used to be scared of yoga when I practiced at the yoga centre. Yoga there is almost no different than any other exercises where you are expected to stretch and sweat yourselves as much as you can. I'm not saying it is not good. But to me, I find yoga much more appealing when it caters to our own pace, stretches ourselves, at the same time reminds us to not force ourselves too much, but rather to appreciate where we are and stay present with each of our breaths and movements of the body. I find yoga more than just a physical exercise. It's a "moving meditation" that exercise your body and calm your mind, which strikes a balance between where we want to be and where we actually are.

This morning I practiced [Warrior 3](http://www.ekhartyoga.com/video/learn-the-challenging-warrior-iii-pose). Challenging man! Especially when I had to stay in lunges for 3 continuous breaths and balance myself in Warrior 3. I need to strengthen my legs more. I can see the improvement in my legs' strength when I do Warrior 1 and 2. But it's still not enough for long pose in lunges and Warrior 3.

Vinyasa practice focuses on the movement of breaths, where each in-breath and out-breath links to the movement between yoga postures (asanas). It can make me sweat even at its beginner level. 

Some useful information I've read on [Vinyasa Yoga](http://www.ekhartyoga.com/everything-yoga/yoga-styles/vinyasa-yoga). 

Vinyasa is one of many yoga styles, which originated from Hatha Yoga (Yoga students often begin with Hatha Yoga where the focus is on the alignment of yoga pose). Vinyasa, on the other hand, place attention on the breath and the movement between the asanas (yoga poses). The length of each in-breath or out-breath dictates the transitioning time between asanas. The breathing style in Vinyasa is called *Ujjayi* where we breath in from our noses and breath out from our throats. You can hear the ocean sound when doing *Ujjayi* breathing. This is a relaxing breathing style which also helps us to stay more focus in our breaths. 

One important principle in Vinyasa Yoga is the muscle locking/contraction (*Bandha*). There are 3 Bandhas:

- Mūla Bandha - where you tighten the muscles around the pelvic and between your legs (perineum area). 
- Uḍḍīyāna Bandha - where you bring the navel in towards the spine and slightly up, at the same time, contract the muscles of your lower abdominal area.
- Jālaṅdhara Bandha - where you lower your chin slightly while raising the chest bone (sternum), bring your gaze to the tip of the nose.

Practicing Vinyasa Yoga regularly will improve your health, both physically and mentally.
- Calming - The steady cycle of inhales and exhales provides you with a calming, mental focal point.

- Purification of body -The continual movements, from one pose to another, gives you an added cardiovascular benefit creating internal heat. The increased circulation and sweat leads to purification of the body.

- Increase muscle strength & flexibility - the routines, weather they are slow paced or fast paced are a great workout for your body.

- Brings you to the present - Yoga opens you up to this moment, which is all there is and which is the doorway to experience truth and real happiness.


Okay, let's do more practice. If only I can do this, I can go and teach Yoga lol!
