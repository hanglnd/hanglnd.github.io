This is the [yoga video](http://www.ekhartyoga.com/video/learn-the-challenging-warrior-iii-pose) I practiced this morning, a Vinyasa practice for Warrior 3 pose. I find it challenging, especially to stay in lunges for 3 continuous breaths and balance myself in Warrior 3. I need to strengthen my legs more. I can see the improvement in my legs' strength when I do Warrior 1 and 2. But it's still not enough for long pose in lunges and Warrior 3. 

Vinyasa practice focuses on the movement of breaths, where each in-breath and out-breath links to the movement between yoga postures (asanas). It can make me sweat even at its beginner level.

Some interesting information I've read on Vinyasa style: ([source](http://www.ekhartyoga.com/everything-yoga/yoga-styles/vinyasa-yoga))
> Vinyasa, like all yoga styles, originated from Hatha yoga. The term vinyāsa refers to the alignment of movement and breath, which turns static asanas (poses) into a dynamic flow.

> The length of one inhale or one exhale dictates the length of time spent transitioning between asanas. Attention is placed on the breath and the journey between the asanas rather than solely on achieving perfect body alignment in a pose, as in Hatha Yoga. 

>The breathing style used is a relaxed diaphragmatic style of breathing, like an ocean sound which resonates in the throat (ujjayi).

>Another major principle of Vinyasa Yoga is the bandha, or muscle locking/contraction, which assists you in retaining a pose and moving safely in and out of poses. There are 3 Bandhas.

> - Mūla Bandha: tightening the muscles around the pelvic and perineum area. 
> - Uḍḍīyāna Bandha: bringing the navel in towards the spine and slightly up. contracting the muscles of the lower abdominal area.
> - Jālaṅdhara Bandha: lowering the chin slightly while raising the sternum bringing the gaze to the tip of the nose.

Benefits of regular Vinyasa practice:
> - Calming - The steady cycle of inhales and exhales provides you with a calming, mental focal point.

> - Purification of body -The continual movements, from one pose to another, gives you an added cardiovascular benefit creating internal heat. The increased circulation and sweat leads to purification of the body.

> - Increase muscle strength & flexibility - the routines, weather they are slow paced or fast paced are a great workout for your body.

> - Brings you to the present - Yoga opens you up to this moment, which is all there is and which is the doorway to experience truth and real happiness.

I used to be scared of yoga when I practiced at the yoga centre. Yoga there is almost no different than any other exercises where you are expected to stretch and sweat yourselves as much as you can. I'm not saying it is not good. But to me, I find yoga much more appealing when it caters to our own pace, stretches ourselves, at the same time reminds us to not force ourselves too much, but rather to appreciate where we are and stay present with each of our breaths and movements of the body. I find yoga more than just a physical exercise. It's a "moving meditation" that exercise your body and calm your mind, which strikes a balance between where we want to be and where we actually are.
