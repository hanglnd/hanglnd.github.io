title:  'Yoga - Practice Hard or Gentle?'
categories: yoga

Yoga has been a part in my life recently. I like to practice yoga, not only for its many health benefits, but also for its spiritual elements which I totally can relate to. I’m trying to do yoga everyday, so every morning when I woke up, the first things came to my head was to meditate and do yoga. That’s enough to start my day.

For a while I’ve been wondering if we should practice hard or gentle on the mat. Some yoga instructors I had practiced with emphasised on stretching and building stamina while others would remind us to be gentle with our practice. Personally I would prefer the later approach as it’s more relaxing and enjoyable, however, I also find it make sense that we need to stretch to make improvement. So, more or less?

This morning, I practiced “Gentle beginners Yoga practice” with Esther Ekhart where I found the answer. She explained that if you are a type of personality that works very hard in your job and your life in general, then you should attempt to work less hard in yoga to balance it. And if you tend to not work so hard and take it easy and sort of try to get out of things then you could use yoga to put in a little more effort. I think it’s all about finding our own balance in our life and we practice it on the yoga mat. 

For me, there were certainly times that I was hard on myself, though the last time I could recall about it was during my university time. That means at this moment I’m more like someone who likes to take it easy and wants a relaxing life. So practicing a bit harder on the yoga mat would be good for me. 

My dreamline in the next 6 months would be to be flexible in some yoga poses which are challenging to me today, like, head to knee pose, pigeon pose, seated forward bend…

If you’re keen in practicing yoga at home (like I am) or even if you are new to yoga and would like to try some very beginner poses to get a feel about it, I would recommend this very resourceful website www.EkhartYoga.com. I bumped into this site while searching for some yoga lessons in YouTube and I had enjoyed many free lessons from Esther Ekhart (from YouTube as well as her website). One thing that I really like about her teaching is that she frequently reminds me of the right attitude to have when practising yoga. She is very authentic and you could feel that she communicates to you from her heart.  

On her website you can find many useful information on different yoga poses and yoga styles. There are lessons of various yoga levels to suit your capability. I’m still at Beginner level and I plan to complete the “Beginners Next Step Program” before this year ends.

Do check it out and I hope you’ll like it as much as I do :)
