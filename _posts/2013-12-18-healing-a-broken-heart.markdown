Imagine you are happily proposed to by your dream guy, only to hear from your man a few months later that he changes his mind and no longer wants to be with you.What would you feel? How heartbreaking it could be!

Tristan Prettyman was in the exact position, except that her fiancé was a very famous singer/songwriter, Jason Mraz. 

I was listening to his beautiful song “I won’t give up” and was curious enough to read up sideline stories about him and his songs and that was when I bumped into an interview of his ex-fiancee, Tristan Prettyman, where she openly shared how she felt and how she managed to get over it. I think her response will be helpful for anyone who find themselves in that kind of situation.

"Initially I was frustrated and for a long time I was very sad”, Tristan said, "But one day I had a thought: I don't want to be with someone that doesn’t want to be with me, I wanna be with someone that can't get enough of me!"


I couldn’t agree more. As simple as that. The world is big, there will surely be a better match, and there’ll be likely more than one person who can love you whole-heartedly for who you are. 


Knowing that is the first step to move on and reclaim the happy life that you deserve. 

And sometimes, we’ll need to thank those worst moments for the best inspiration that it brings to us. For Tristan, the breakup got her to get back to her song-writing which she had put it a rest for four years. Her song, “I Was Gonna Marry You”, is both personal and universally relatable. I find the melody and her singing voice really soothing.

I particularly love the “Turn it into GOLD” part of her advices:

***Your story, your feelings, your experience, they are all yours, and they are valid. And chances are, someone, somewhere is experiencing the same things. So don't be afraid to share, to vent, to sing, to throw paint at a canvas, or start a blog. All of that icky, uncomfortable energy you are carrying…Its primo fuel to turn into something positive.***

Who knows the worst thing that happened could open up an opportunity that you never thought of?
