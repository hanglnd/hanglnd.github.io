I don’t have a cheerful-looking face. Unless I smile, or when I force a smile. 

Sometimes it really bothers me. When I’m with a friend and we are not talking, I could look quite unfriendly. When I’m with my husband and I got nothing to say, at times he would ask why I look so down. When I woke up in the middle of my sleep, I could feel my face kind-of grumpy, as if I was feeling annoyed about something. 

Most of the time, as suggested by my “down” or tensed face, I’m not quite happy. There’s seemingly some uncomfortable emotion lying inside me. I don’t know, maybe other people may feel the same themselves too. But as I observe, there are many people who are naturally cheerful and welcoming, like at least my husband and my best friend Jun. 

So I ask myself, why can’t I have a natural happy face? Is there really something unresolved inside me? Or is it simply because I’m not feeling well?

Then I came across the concept of “pain body” introduced by Ekhart Tolle which I immediately could relate to myself. As put by [Eckhart Tolle](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eckhart-tolle/living-in-presence-with-y_b_753114.html) , "There is such a thing as old emotional pain living inside you. It is an accumulation of painful life experience that was not fully faced and accepted in the moment it arose. It leaves behind an energy form of emotional pain. It comes together with other energy forms from other instances, and so after some years you have a "painbody," an energy entity consisting of old emotion.”

So everyone has his/her own pain-body where those unhappy memories and unresolved emotion are hidden. They could be the resentment we had in the past towards some one, some situation, or the anger or sadness we had suppressed in ourselves. I had a lot of such moments too. And my usual “down" face and mood may have resulted from all the accumulated unresolved emotion from the past, my own pain-body. 

So the question is, what should we do with our pain-body?

I found the answer from Eckhart’s sharing about a [woman](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/563043-a-woman-in-her-thirties-came-to-see-me-as)  who came to see him with her heavy pain-body. He asked her to look at the feeling inside her body and completely accept that this was what she felt at that moment, without wanting it to go away. Once she did so, she felt a space around her unhappiness and “it seems to matter less”. Eckhart explained that the place "comes when there is inner acceptance of whatever you are experiencing in the present moment."


I’ve tried this approaching for the past few days. When I notice that my face got tensed or down, I told myself that it may come from my pain-body. I don’t need it to go away, I don’t need to force a smile, I would just give my tensed face some space, knowing that the pain-body could there and it’s part of who I am. At that moment I felt lightened and softened and my face just relaxed. 


I will continue to apply that “tip” of looking inside and accepting my pain-body and I hope that it will become happier, which will in turn make my face-by-default happier :). 


Meanwhile, I will read more about this topic from [“The Power of Now”](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Now-Spiritual-Enlightenment/dp/1577314808)  which is right on my hand now :)
