If I could give 2013 a name, it would be a "Courage Year" in my life, where I took initiatives for changes I desired.

***My working life:***
Many ups and downs happened in my work, (well, as usual!) but in 2013 they translated to action. First, I decided to transfer to a new department in April and had great time working in a fast pace over there. In 2 months I accomplished  even more than I had in the last 2 years. My confidence and self-esteem were boosted as a result.

Again, everything is impermanent. From Jun to Sep, I had a hard time struggling as I worked with a new boss. Although I took initiative and a leap of faith to complete a challenging project on my own, I still felt a lot of dissatisfaction about the way my bosses handled things. At the same time, I couldn’t see real value in what I was doing. In the end, I told my bosses that I wanted to leave. A boss in another department offered me to work for him in a new role which I thought was exciting. So, instead of quitting, I took 2 month no-pay leave and would come back to a new post after the Lunar New Year.

Looking back, I think most of the struggles I had resulted from the conflicts between my own expectation (of my work, of that from others) and the reality, which was how things happened to be. Could I have done better? I don’t know. I’m just grateful for all that happened. 


***My personal life:***
On the superficial level, I went through a big change in my life. I married my 5-year boyfriend in July. We went to Australia for honeymoon in Aug. We’ve been living as a husband-and-wife for 5 months. To me, it was a natural flow. Nothing much to adjust actually. We are still the way we were. And we are happier now since we no longer have to say goodbyes when sending each other home, and we don’t have to eat out that often any more. We cook healthy meals at home, explore new dishes and adventure into regular exercise. Of course, we have some issues to overcome. Let’s just be patient and encouraging to each other, including ourselves!

Deeper level, I feel some shift in my way of thinking. I’ve been more decisive to live the life I want. That’s why I intended to leave even without a job, to focus my energy in improving my physical health and enriching my emotional/spiritual health. Now that I am in my 2-month break, I spent my days meditating, doing yoga, reading books and cooking. Oh yes, I think I’m now a much better cook that I was a few months ago.


So in short, what have I learnt in 2013? Listed below in my random thought sequence:

   * I learn to not worry about what other people think and talk about me. How? by knowing that most of the time they are too busy (thinking about themselves) to think about me.
   * I learn to be responsible for my own happiness. I learn to take action and be fully responsible for the outcomes. To live is to be alive and to be happy.
   * I learn (from my mistakes) to not talk bad about other people. Not even a word of complaining/saying negative things about person A to person B. I want freedom. I know my freedom doesn’t come when I gossip about one person to another. 
   * I learn to not to think about people that I don’t enjoy. Why bring myself down by engaging with negative people even when they are not in front of me? Simply drop them out of my head.
   * I learn to embrace my desires, to not put them down out of laziness and fear. At this moment I’m in love with living a healthy and happy life, in meditation and yoga, so I give my time and energy for them. 
   * I learn that my happiness come from the present, from doing what I love right here right now, not from hoping for something good turning out in the future. No! I’ve been waiting for the past 4 years and nothing new happened. 


My resolutions in 2014?

   * I want to have my own blog to journal and share about my growth as I learn to embrace my life. 
   * I want to be healthier: be more energetic (means less sleepy and tired in daytime), be more flexible in my yoga practice (hope to climb up to level 3 in next week). 
   * I want to be more present. That is to live more and more into the Now and appreciate every moment as it is. Okay, to be more “down-to-earth”, it means I want to be more alert and vibrant. 
   * I want to find a way for passive/side income. I’m young, I want freedom and I can do more!
   * I want to know and love myself more! My body as well.

Hello 2014!
