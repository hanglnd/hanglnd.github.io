title:  'How to Cook Delicious Chicken Congee'

Last week, my husband suddenly craved for congee and since we had chicken ready in the fridge, I decided to make chicken congee. The last few times I tried, it didn’t turn out great, so this time I googled for recipes and in the end I  followed a YouTube video posted by [Helen’s Recipes](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=helen+chao+ga&sm=3)  (Btw, I found YouTube a great learning channel, especially for cooking. The next time you look for some recipes, do include youtube search, you may find easy-to-follow tutorials there).

My chicken congee turned out delicious with soothing texture and beautiful aroma. My husband was surprised to taste it given how he was used to my so-so rice-cooker congee the previous times haha.

Here is how I cooked it, based on Helen’s Recipes:

Chicken Congee 

Total cooking time: 2.5 hours

Preparation (serves 2 - 3)  


   * 1 cup jasmine rice
   * 1 cup glutinous rice
   * 2 chicken thighs with skin removed

   * 1 shallot
   * 1 piece ginger, peeled 
   * Spring onions
   * Salt, pepper

Cooking steps:


  1. Mix 1 cup of jasmine rice and 1 cup of glutinous rice and soak in water for 1 hour 
  2. In a large pot, boil the chicken with a peeled shallot and 1/2 teaspoon of salt, until the chicken is cooked (for 2 chicken thighs, it takes about 30 mins)
  3. Take the chicken out put it aside until it cools down.
  4. Pour the rice into the chicken soup (remember to pour the soaking water away!). Add in a piece of smashed ginger
  5. Bring the the mixture to high heat. Let the rice be boiled for 5 mins.
  6. Turn off the heat and let the rice rest in the pot for 45 mins, during which the rice will be soften and expanded. Put on the lid.
  7. Meanwhile, shred the chicken into small pieces, you can add back the bones into the soup
  8. Once the rice is soft, bring up the heat to medium
  9. Stir the rice frequently (once every 1-2 minutes) for about 15 minutes.
  10. Add the shredded chicken into the soup. Stir well.
  11. Season to taste with salt, pepper and fish source. 
  12. Garnish with ginger and chopped spring onions, and serve hot.
  13. Enjoy your chicken congee. 

Note:


   * How much rice is enough? Usually the amount of rice cooked for congee is about half of the amount you cook for normal rice portion. That means if you usually cook 2 cup of rice for 2 people, you may only need 1 cup when cooking congee, as the rice cooked in the congee soup will be much expanded. Both my husband and I are big eaters and we wanted congee for our dinner, so I cooked almost the same amount of rice I normally cook. 
   * How much water? Generally the ratio of rice to water is 1:6. However it very much depends on how thick or how soupy you want to congee to be. Start with the ratio 1:6 first and if you find it too thick you can always add more water as you cook.
   * Do we need to remove the chicken skin? The skin is most fattening part of a chicken, so I would recommend to remove to enjoy a more healthy congee. However you don’t need to if you like the very tasty congee and don’t mind the “fatty” taste.
   * Do we need both jasmine and glutinous rice? Not necessary. Some recipes require only jasmine rice while others only glutinous rice. Jasmine rice gives the congee fragrance where glutinous rice help make it soft and sticky. No hard and fast rule, mix it as you desire. For me, I would prefer more sticky taste, so next time, i’m gonna try adding more of glutinous rice.

Chicken congee is best to serve in a cold or rainy day. You can have it for breakfast or anytime you feel like changing from a normal meals. Chicken congee is known traditionally in Vietnamese as a healing soup if you catch a cold or fever, for its health-promoting ingredients such as ginger. 

Next time when my parents come to visit us, I will make this for them :)
