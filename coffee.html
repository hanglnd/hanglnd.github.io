      <h3>Coffee Catering Website</h3>
      <br/>
      <p>A good friend of mine was about to start a business in mobile coffee catering and asked me to help her design a website. This is perhaps the closest to actual client work that I've done. I went through the entire web design process: gathering business requirements, research, wireframing, UI design and evaluation. We discussed about the content and styles of the website as well as how we want the users to interact with it. I studied dozen of competitor websites as well as other popular websites to gather ideas about UI layout and learn from them how their functionalities work.</p>
