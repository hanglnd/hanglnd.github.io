      <h3>Next Bus Arrival Mobile App</h3>
      <br/>
      <p>As a frequent bus commuter, I rely on an app called bus arrival timing to find out when my next bus will arrive. Some difficulties I had with this app were 1) locating the correct bus stop and 2) save a bus number into favourite and 3) look up for favourite bus number quickly when opening the app. I had tried a few similar apps but they all gave me some inconveniences of sort. Well, I don't mean to expect too much from a free app though. But this gave me a great opportunity to redesign the app based on my expectations from users' point of view.</p>
      <p>I identify 3 main tasks users want to do with the app, amongst other tasks:</p>
      <p>1) they are waiting at the bus stop and want to find out when their bus will be coming<br/>
      2) they want to know whether the bus will be crowded so that they can decide which bus to take<br/>
      3) they want to quickly view the arrival timing the bus number they had saved in the favourite earlier</p>
      <p>For each task, I mapped out the flow and identified important features required. This was incorporated as I sketched out the draft and later designed a prototype. There are 2 clear sections in the header: NEARBY and FAVOURITE. The NEARBY tab provides users with only 3 nearest bus stops instead of a long list, together with prominent bus stop names and numbers, to make it faster to them to scan and select the right one. I also streamlined the flow of adding a bus number into FAVOURITE by providing a quick "star" button for user to click on and store their the favourite bus numbers (grouped and displayed by the nearest location) in the FAVOURITE tab (which will be landed screen when they open the app).</p>
